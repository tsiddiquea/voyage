                    <p><strong>Tips:</strong>Mulu can be visited all year around. Since it is a rainforest, you can expect frequent cooling rains. But we recommend not going between July and September as they are the hottest and driest month which make trekking more difficult. We suggest packing raincoat, non-slip closed footwear, torchlight, water bottle, insect repellent and hat.</p>
